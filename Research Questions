Research Questions: 

* RQ1: Does communication matter? 
    Does the number of comments that a mentor and mentee have on each other affect the success of a relationship?
    No. Of conversation vs sentiment analysis-hugging face, no of questions, tone of sentences, the influence of input from other repo members
    Race and ethnicity of mentor and mentee (analysis by name or inputted location) 
RQ2: Does participation matter?
    Does the amount of pull requests a mentee makes affect mentorship success?
    (Does interest matter? User data before and after the project (no of commits on the project after, types of projects worked on before)
* RQ3: Does experience matter? 
    Does the mentor or mentee's experience (time on GitHub) affect the success?
RQ4: Does gender matter?
    In the case of women, do more women mentors with women mentees affect their success?
* RQ5: Does guiding documentation matter? 
    Do pull request labels guide mentees? Are pull request labels that are made for the newcomer/mentee helpful in success?
RQ6: Does location matter?
    Does the geographical location between the mentor and the mentee change how their relationship operates? Mentors and mentees from the same country might have similar cultures/languages/customs and relate to one another this way. Similar time zones would allow for quicker responses between the mentee and mentor.
    Distance between mentor and mentee (time between conversation responses)
